# Laptop Price Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict laptop prices using various machine learning models.

## Objectives
- Predict the price of laptops based on features such as brand, specifications, etc.
- Compare different machine learning models to find the best performing model.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes information on laptop prices and features.

## Methods
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.

## Results
The Random Forest model provided the best performance with an RÂ² score of 0.85.

## Conclusion
The model can be used to predict laptop prices with reasonable accuracy. Further improvements can be made by incorporating more features and using advanced models.
